## Flutter E-Commerce App
This is a Flutter-based e-commerce application that allows users to create an account, browse and purchase items, create a favorites section, explore categories, and edit their profiles. The app interacts with a custom API for authentication and other backend operations.

## Features
User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their email address and password. Upon successful registration, users will receive a confirmation email.

Authentication: Users can securely log in to their accounts using their registered email and password. Authentication is handled through the custom API.

Product Listing: The app provides a catalog of products that users can browse. Each product includes details such as name, description, price, and an image.

Product Search: Users can search for specific products using keywords or filters.

Cart Management: Users can add items to their shopping cart, view the contents of the cart, update quantities, and remove items.

Checkout: Users can proceed to the checkout process, enter shipping and payment details, and place an order.

Favorites Section: Users can mark products as favorites and access them later in a dedicated favorites section.

Categories Section: Products are organized into different categories. Users can explore products by category to find what they are looking for easily.

Profile Management: Users can view and edit their profile information, including name, email address, and shipping address.
